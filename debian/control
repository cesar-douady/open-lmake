Description: pythonic workflow management system
 Build systems like GNU Make are frequently used to create complicated
 workflows. This project aims to reduce the complexity of creating workflows
 by automatically handling dependencies, together with a fast and
 comfortable execution environment.
 It leverages Python for the user interface and is scalable to millions of jobs.
