# This is a very simple proof of concept to show how C++20 modules can be supported with no naming convention between file names and module names.
# The principle is to build a mapping logical-name -> physical-name in the form of symbolic links in the top level map_dir directory.
# This way, it can be used during compilation with suitable mapping

# It is solely validated on the inputs derived from : https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1689r5.html.
# The only difference is that _m has been added to module names to show that they is no relation between physical names and logical names.

# In a real world flow one could/should:
# - Generate the mapping logical-name -> physical-name in a hiearchical way to avoid reconstructing the world each time a file is added/removed
#   (although this is pretty fast).
# - Use a conformant dep-scanning tool when one is available/identified.
# - Implement a true compilation flow.
