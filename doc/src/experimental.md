# Experimental features

The features described herein are experimental as long as they have not been thoroughly used.

If you plan to use one of those, best is to be in contact with the development team to:

- get dedicated support
- make necessary evolutions so as to fit your needs as they appear

As a consequence, it is most probable that the specifications will evolve in a non-backward compatible way.
