# Video mode

If lmake is connected to a terminal, then the terminal foreground and background colors are probed and if the brightness of the background color is less than that of the foreground color,
video mode is set to normal, else it is set to reverse.

In that case, lmake output is colored and the (configurable) color set is chosen depending on video mode.
