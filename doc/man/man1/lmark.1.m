Header(lmark,mark jobs and files with specific attributes)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
There are 2 possible marks :
Item(B(freeze))
This mark prevents jobs from being run.
Instead its targets (as built during the last run) behave as sources.
If no job generated a file provided in arguments, this file behaves as a source.
Item(B(no-trigger))
This mark prevents OpenLmake to trigger builds of dependent jobs after modifications of mentioned files.
However, this applies only if job was last run with success.

.LP
Jobs and files so marked and that have been used are repeated in the summary.
This precaution is taken because such presence goes against repeatability and should be suppressed before commiting the repo.

.LP
Frozen jobs are useful to run a flow from A to `B'.
To do that you type B(lmark -af A) followed by B(lmake `B').

.LP
No trigger files are useful when working on a foundation file (called I(utils.h) hereinafter).
It is common to work on I(utils.h) to add new features.
During such developments, it is practical to run a test suite that checks the new feature.
But to run this test suite, you probably need a lot a derived files that depend on I(utils.h) without using the new feature (e.g. I(a.o), I(b.o), I(c.o) which are not the focus of your development).
It is then a waste of time and resources to rebuild these derived files for each tiny modification.
An easy way is :
Bullet Mark I(utils.h) with B(no-trigger).
Bullet Write the new test that uses this new feature.
Bullet Modify I(utils.h) to implement the new feature.
Bullet Run your test.
Files not using the new feature will likely be successfully built and will not be uselessly rebuilt.
File using the new feature will likely fail and will be usefully rebuilt.
If no error is generated, it is easy to run C(rm) or C(lforget) to force rebuild.
Bullet Loop on edit/test until feature is ok.
Bullet When you are satisfied with the new feature, suppress the no-trigger mark and rerun your test suite to ensure repeatability.

SubCommands
Item(B(-a),B(--add))    mark mentioned jobs or files.
Item(B(-d),B(--delete)) remove mark from mentioned jobs or files.
Item(B(-l),B(--list))   list marked files. This is a global sub-command and not file/job must be provided.
Item(B(-c),B(--clear))  delete all marks. This is a global sub-command and not file/job must be provided.

SpecificOptions
Item(B(-f),B(--freeze))     mark is freeze.
Item(B(-t),B(--no-trigger)) mark is no-trigger.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
V(lmark -fa a_dep)
.LP
V(lmake depend_on_a_dep) # a_dep not remade
.LP
V(lmake -fc)
.LP
V(lmake depend_on_a_dep) # a_dep remade if necessary

.SH NOTES
.LP
Where C(lforget) is used to instruct OpenLmake to run jobs that it considers up-to-date, B(lmark) is used the opposite way, to instruct OpenLmake not to run jobs it considers out-of-date.
