Title(lrun_cc,run a C/C++ compiler protecting include dirs)
.SH SYNOPSIS
B(lrun_cc) [-m I(marker)] I(compiler) I(args)...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
B(lrun_cc) runs the program I(compiler) with any given arguments I(args)... .
I(args) are parsed for include or library dirs and calls mkdir on these dirs and C(ldepend) on I(marker) files within these dirs.

The goal is to ensure that these dirs always exist as this is a requirement of most C/C++ compiler to try to read include files within them and hence trigger deps.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
V(lrun_cc -mmrkr gcc -Ia -Ib -Ic -c -o prog.o prog.c)
