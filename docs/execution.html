<h1 id="execution"><a class="header" href="#execution">Execution</a></h1>
<h2 id="handling-an-access"><a class="header" href="#handling-an-access">Handling an access</a></h2>
<p>At first glance, recognizing a target from a dep when a job runs seems pretty easy when the accesses to the disk can be traced: reading a file is a dep, writing to it is a target.
And this is what is done informally, but there are a lot of corner cases.</p>
<p>The specification described below has been carefully designed to allow open-lmake to run adequate jobs to reach a stable state from any starting point.
More specifically, think of the following sequence:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clean -ffdx
lmake foo
git pull
lmake foo
</code></pre>
<p>The second <code>lmake foo</code> command is supposed to do the minimum work to reach the same content of <code>foo</code> as would be obtained with the sequence:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git pull
git clean -ffdx
lmake foo
</code></pre>
<p>This is what stable state means: the content of <code>foo</code> is independent of the history and only depends on the rules and the content of sources, both being managed through <code>git</code> in this example.</p>
<p>In this specification, dirs are ignored (i.e. the presence or content of a dir has no impact) and symbolic links are similar to regular files whose content is the link itself.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-writing-files"><a class="header" href="#reading-and-writing-files">Reading and writing files</a></h3>
<p>The first point is to precisely know what reading and writing mean.</p>
<p>Writing to file <code>foo</code> means:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system call that writes or initiate writing to <code>foo</code>, e.g. <code>open("foo",O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC)</code> or <code>symlink(...,"foo")</code>, assuming the <code>autodep</code> rule attribute is not set to <code>'none'</code>.</li>
<li>Unlinking <code>foo</code>, e.g. <code>unlink("foo")</code>, is also deemed to be writing to it.</li>
<li>A call to <code>lmake.target('foo',write=True)</code>.</li>
<li>The execution of <code>ltarget -W foo</code>.</li>
<li>Under the condition that these actions are not preceded by a call to <code>lmake.target('foo',ignore=True)</code> or the execution of <code>ltarget -I foo</code>.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> does not match a <code>targets</code> or <code>side_targets</code> entry with the <code>Ignore</code> flag set.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> lies in the repo (i.e. under the dir containing <code>Lmakefile.py</code> but not in its <code>LMAKE/lmake</code> sub-dir).</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading file <code>foo</code> means :</p>
<ul>
<li>A system call that reads or initiate reading <code>foo</code>, e.g. <code>open("foo",O_RDONLY)</code>, <code>readlink("foo",...)</code> or <code>stat("foo",...)</code>,
assuming the <code>autodep</code> rule attribute is not set to <code>'none'</code>.</li>
<li>Unless the <code>config.link_support</code> attribute is set to <code>'none'</code>,
any access (reading or writing) to <code>foo</code> which follows symlinks is an implicit <code>readlink</code>.</li>
<li>Unless the <code>config.link_support</code> attribute is set to <code>'file'</code> or <code>'none'</code>,
any access (reading or writing) to <code>foo</code>, whether it follows symlinks or not, is an implicit <code>readlink</code> of all dirs leading to it.</li>
<li>Note that some system calls can be both a read and a write, e.g. <code>open("foo", O_RDWR)</code> but also <code>rename("foo",...)</code>.
In that case, the read occurs before the write.</li>
<li>A call to <code>lmake.depend('foo',read=True)</code>.</li>
<li>The execution of <code>ldepend -R foo</code>.</li>
<li>Under the condition that these actions are not preceded by a call to <code>lmake.depend('foo',ignore=True)</code> or the execution of <code>ldepend -I foo</code>.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> is not listed in <code>deps</code> or matches a <code>side_deps</code> entry, with the <code>Ignore</code> flag set.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> lies in the repo (i.e. under the dir containing <code>Lmakefile.py</code> but not in its <code>LMAKE/lmake</code> sub-dir) or in a source dir.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reading-a-dir"><a class="header" href="#reading-a-dir">Reading a dir</a></h3>
<p>A dir <code>foo</code> is read when files it contains are listed, which occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system call that reads dir <code>foo</code>, e.g. <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html">getdents(2)</a>.</li>
<li>A libc call that reads dir <code>foo</code>, e.g. <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readdir.3.html">readdir(3)</a> or <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/glob.3.html">glob(3)</a>
(in which its pattern argument requires reading <code>foo</code>).</li>
<li>Under the condition that these actions are not preceded by a call to <code>lmake.target('foo',ignore=True)</code> or the execution of <code>ltarget -I foo</code>.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that neither <code>lmake.target('foo',incremental=True)</code> was called nor <code>ltarget -i foo</code> executed.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> does not match a <code>targets</code> or <code>side_targets</code> entry with the <code>ignore</code> or <code>incremental</code> flags set.</li>
<li>Also under the condition that <code>foo</code> lies in the repo (i.e. under the dir containing <code>Lmakefile.py</code> but not in its <code>LMAKE/lmake</code> sub-dir) or is the repo root dir.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although dirs do not exist for open-lmake, reading dir <code>foo</code> is an error unless:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="unit_tests/wine.html#:~:text=readdir%5Fok%20%3D%20True">Set the <code>readdir_ok</code> flag as a rule attribute</a>.</li>
<li><a href="unit_tests/mandelbrot.html#:~:text=side%5Fdeps%20%3D%20%7B%20%27DIR%27%20%3A%20%28%20%27mandelbrot%2F%7B%2A%3A%2E%2A%7D%27%20%2C%20%27readdir%5Fok%27%20%29%20%7D">Passing the <code>readdir_ok</code> flag</a>
in the <code>targets</code>, <code>side_targets</code> or <code>side_deps</code> entry.</li>
<li><a href="unit_tests/pyc.html#:~:text=lmake%2Edepend%28%27%2E%27%2Creaddir%5Fok%3DTrue%29%20%23%20this%20rule%20is%20a%20Rule%2C%20not%20a%20PyRule%2C%20on%20purpose%20%28so%20pyc%20files%20are%20not%20handled%29%2C%20so%20we%20must%20explicitly%20allow%20reading%20%27%2E%27">Calling <code>lmake.depend('foo',readdir_ok=True)</code></a>
or executing <code>ldepend -D foo</code>.</li>
<li>Calling <code>lmake.target('foo',readdir_ok=True)</code> or executing <code>ltarget -D foo</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>lmake.PyRule</code> base class sets the the <code>readdir_ok</code> flag on dirs mentioned in <code>sys.path</code> when executing import in python3.
This is because python3 optimizes imports by pre-reading these dirs.</p>
<p>Such restrictions ensure the reliability of job execution as the content of a dir is mostly unpredictable as it depends on the past history:
files may or may not have been already built, or previously built files that are now non-buildable may still exist.</p>
<p>Ideally, listing a dir would lead to all buildable files (or sub-dirs), but this is not doable in the generic case as such list may be infinite.
So open-lmake reverts to letting the user deal with this question, using an opt-in approach so the user cannot miss it.</p>
<p>Note that if such a dir is marked as <code>incremental</code>, the user already has the responsibility of handling its past history and there is no need for an additional flag.</p>
<h3 id="being-a-target"><a class="header" href="#being-a-target">Being a target</a></h3>
<p>A file may be a target from the begining of the job execution, or it may become a target during job execution.
In the latter case, it is not a target until the point where it becomes one.
A file cannot stop being a target: once it has become a target, this is until the end of the job execution.</p>
<p>A file is a target from the begining of the job execution if it matches a <code>targets</code> or <code>side_targets</code> entry.</p>
<p>A file becomes a target when :</p>
<ul>
<li>It is written to (with the meaning mentioned above)..</li>
<li><code>lmake.target</code> or <code>ltarget</code> is called unless the flag <code>source_ok</code> is finally set (i.e. including if set independently).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="being-a-dep"><a class="header" href="#being-a-dep">Being a dep</a></h3>
<p>A file may be a dep from the begining of the job execution, or it may become a dep during job execution.</p>
<p>A file cannot stop being a dep : once it has become a dep, this is until the end of the job execution.</p>
<p>A file is a dep from the begining of the job execution if it listed as a <code>deps</code> in the rule.</p>
<p>A file becomes a dep when it is read (with the meaning mentioned above) while not a target at that time.</p>
<h3 id="errors"><a class="header" href="#errors">Errors</a></h3>
<p>Some cases lead to errors, independently of the user script.</p>
<p>The first case is when there is clash between static declarations.
<code>targets</code>, <code>side_targets</code>, <code>side_deps</code> entries may or may not contain star stems.
In the latter case, and including the static deps listed in <code>deps</code>, they are static entries.
It is an error if the same file is listed several times as a static entry.</p>
<p>The second case is when a file is both a dep and a target.
You may have noticed that the definition above does not preclude this case, mostly because a file may start its life as a dep and become a target.
This is an error unless either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file is finally unlinked (or was never created).</li>
<li>Its <code>source_ok</code> flag has been set and its <code>incremental</code> one is not.<br />
This allows rules that alter sources to choose between handling any previous content without impact on final value (<code>incremental</code>)
or compute value based on previous one (in which case it must be a dep).
In this latter case, the job will rerun if such dep-target is actually modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third case is when a target was not declared as such.
<code>foo</code> can be declared as target by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matching a <code>targets</code> or <code>side_targets</code> entry.</li>
<li>Calling <code>lmake.target('foo')</code> (unless <code>allow=False</code> is passed).</li>
<li>Executing <code>ltarget foo</code> in which the <code>-a</code> option is not passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A target that is not declared is an error.</p>
<h3 id="processing-a-target"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-target">Processing a target</a></h3>
<p>Targets are normally erased before the start of the job execution, unless they are sources or flagged as <code>incremental</code>.
In case a target is also a dep, it is automatically flagged as <code>incremental</code>, whether it is an error or not.</p>
<p>If a job is run when a not <code>incremental</code> and not source target exists, it is deemed unreliable and is rerun.</p>
<h3 id="best-effort"><a class="header" href="#best-effort">Best effort</a></h3>
<p>Open-lmake tries to minimize the execution of jobs, but may sometimes miss a point and execute a job superfluously.
This may include erasing a file that has no associated production rule.
Unless a file is a dep of no job, open-lmake may rebuild it at any time, even when not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>In the case open-lmake determines that a file may have actually been written manually outside its control, it prevents overwriting a potentially valuable user-generated content.
In that case, open-lmake quarantines the file under the <a href="meta_data.html#:~:text=LMAKE%2Fquarantine">LMAKE/quarantine</a> dir with its original name.
This quarantine mechanism, which is not necessary for open-lmake processing but is a facility for the user, is best effort.
There are cases where open-lmake cannot anticipate such an overwrite (for example if a job writes to a target while it dit not during the previous run,
open-lmake could not anticipate this would occur).</p>
<p>A typical case is when source files are auto-generated.
The user may mistakenly fix the generated file, thinking they are fixing a source.
In that case, open-lmake will detect this case and regenerate this file so as to ensure reproducibility, thus potentially overwriting valuable content.</p>
<h2 id="tmp-dir"><a class="header" href="#tmp-dir">tmp dir</a></h2>
<p>The physical dir is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>$TMPDIR</code> is set to an empty string, there is no tmp dir.</li>
<li>If open-lmake is supposed to keep this dir after job execution, it is a dir under <code>LMAKE/tmp</code>, determined by open-lmake (its precise value is reported by <code>lshow -i</code>).</li>
<li>Else if <code>$TMPDIR</code> is specified in the environment of the job, it is used. Note that it need not be unique as open-lmake will create a unique sub-dir within it.</li>
<li>Else, a dir determined by open-lmake lying in the <code>LMAKE</code> dir.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless open-lmake is instructed to keep this dir, it is erased at the end of the job execution.</p>
<p>At execution time:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>$TMPDIR</code> was set to an empty string, it is removed from the environment and if the job uses the default tmp dir (usually <code>/tmp</code>), an error is generated.</li>
<li>Else <code>$TMPDIR</code> is set so that the job can use it to access the tmp dir.</li>
</ul>
