* purpose *
***********

* lmake is like make, except that it is practical, scalable and reliable
* more specifically :
	- handle parallelism & remote execution
	- automatic dependency tracking :
		- system activity is tracked to detect file accesses (reads & writes)
		- dependencies are automaticcaly added upon read
		- no need for any kind of pre-analysis
		- even dependencies ot non-existing files are keps, in case they appear
	- it is extremely fast :
		- everything is cached, in particular dependencies so that the discovery process is only run when a job is run for the first time or when execution showed they changed
		- up-to-date analysis is based on CRC's, not on date, so that when a target is remade identically to its previous content, dependents are not remade
		- all the internal engine is based on id's, not strings, strings are only used to import (e.g. dep tracking) or export (job execution)
	- it is extremely memory efficient :
		- keeping the state of all dependencies is inherently very expensive
		- thorough efforts are made to keep this book keeping minimal
		- in particular, names (that tend to be rather long in practice) are kept in a prefix-tree sharing the directory parts
	- generally speaking 1.000.000 targets can be handled with no burden
	- makefile is based on Python3.6 (& upward) :
		- no reason to invent a new language
		- each rule is a class
		- can leverage loops, conditions, inheritance, ... all Python power
		- job scripts can be either shell scripts or Python functions
		- very readable, no cabalistic automatic variables make has
	- target matching is based on regular expressions :
		- rather than the very poor '%' of make
		- there can be several stems
		- dependencies are generating using f-strings, very flexible
	- rules may have several targets :
		- usually target list is known before job is executed
		- but target reg-expr is also supported for rules such as untar that generate a bunch of targets whose precise list depends on source content
	- lmake is oriented towards reproducibility :
		- it tracks the source control system (usually git) and refuses to rely on data that are not tracked
			- you can force such dependencies, in which cases these exceptions will be reported at each run
	- and more...

****************
* coding rules *
****************

* statics & globals :
	- variables with executable cxtor/dxtor are never put (or with much care) in statics or globals
		- this includes string's, despite these being declared constexpr in std lib
	- reason is that init order is unpredictible, nor finalization order
	- this induces hard to find bugs
	- when required, a pointer (initilized to nullptr) and a new is done in a timely manner
	- this way, variable is not automatically destructed

* cases :
	- CamelCase for namespaces, types, template parameters and constexpr
	- snake_case for other names

* name prefixes :
	- _  : private (including static functions in .cc files that are de facto not accessible from elsewhere)
	- s_ : static
	- g_ : global
	- t_ : thread local

* names are suffixed with _ if needed to suppress ambiguities

* abbreviations :
	- general rules :
		- words are abbreviated using the following list if they are not exposed to users
		- words may further be abbreviated using only consons when name spans no more than a page (~100 lines)
		  or when such abbreviation makes code more readable
		- words may further be abbreviated to a single letter when name spans no more than a few lines
		- else words are not abbreviated
	- special cases :
		abbrev full-name
		cap       capacity
		del       delete
		dict      dictionary
		dep       dependency
		diff      difference
		dst       destination
		expr      expression
		filename  file_name
		hdr       header
		id        identifier
		idx       index
		len       length
		namespace name_space
		ongoing   on_going
		par       parallel
		proc      procedure, process
		regexpr   regular_expression
		res       result
		rsv       reserv, reserved
		ser       serial
		sock      socket
		symlink   symbolic link
		tab       table
		tmp       temporary
		tmpl      template
		val       value
		wakeup    wake_up

* layout :
	- lines are limited to 200 characters
	- functions are limited to 100 lines :
		- there are a few exceptions, though, where it was impossible to cut without making too artificial a sub-function
	- generally speaking code is put on a single line when several lines are similar and alignment helps readability
	- separators (such as commas, operators, parentheses, ...) pertaining to the same expression are at the same indentation level
		- and subexpressions are at the next indentation level if on one or several lines by themselves
		- the identation level is the number of tab's appearing on the line before the considered item
		- when item is less than 3 characters long, the next indentation level (preceded by a tab) is on the same line
		- expressions are either compact (no space or minimum), spaced (a space between each operators and sub-expressions) or multi-line (with sub-expressions indented)
		- example :
			a = make_a(
				my_first_coef [  0] * my_first_data                            // note alignment makes expression structure appearing immediately
			+	my_second_coef[i  ] * my_second_data                           // note + at identation level 3, subexrpession at indentation level 4
			+	my_third_coef [i*2] * my_third_data                            // note following comment means this one is repeated
			+	my_foorth_coef[i*3] * my_foorth_data                           // .
			) ;

* invariants are either :
	- in swear/fail if reasonably fast to check
	- in a function chk (even if never called) when they can be expressed programatically
	- else in comments preceded by the keyword INVARIANT

* invariants are expected and enforced by public methods :
	- this is a general consideration : methods are private/public depending on their dangerosity
	- private methods can violate them, though
		- e.g. _clear are local methods violating invariants, clear handles consequences
	- public methods can violate unrelated invariants they can live w/
		- e.g. Node.mk_plain does not enforce job invariant about having all its targets set

* data members are :
	- public when they can be modified individually w/o violating invariants
	- private otherwise

* comments :
	- placement w.r.t. code
		- generally, comments start in column 80 (assuming tab of 4 characters)
		- they are put in columns 20, 40 or 60 if commenting lists of short items (data members, enum members, ...)
		- the are always separated with code with at least 1 character and 1 line
		- comments in successive lines are aligned
	- standard comments
		- //vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
		- main purpose of the function
		- //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
		- "XXX"            means something has to be reworked
		- "/!\"            means something requires your special attention
		- "INVARIANT"      means an invariant is described
		- "fast path"      means that the corresponding code can be suppressed without altering the semantic
		- "."              means same as above
		- "..." at the end means comment continue on next line

***********************
* general description *
***********************

* main classes :
	- Req represents an lmake command
		- several Req's may be present as several lmake command may run (but there is a single server serving all of them)
	- Rule represents a derivation rule
		- i.e. a pattern to derive some target files from some source files
	- Job represents a job
		- i.e. a script that may be executed by instantiating a Rule for a particular set of stems
		- a Job has several targets and several dependencies
		- targets may be explicit in the Rule (it is said static), or it may be described as matching a regular expression (it is said star).
			- this is not to be confused by regular expressions used to match a Rule. For example :
				- {File}.o            in a compilation rule   : this is a static target (a Job produces a single .o)
				- {Dir}.untar/{File*} in a tar exapnsion rule : these are star targets  (a Job produces a bunch of files in a single directory)
		- dependencies may be expressed explicitly in the Rule (is is said static), or discovered by spying job execution syscall's (it is said hidden)
			- typically in a compilation rule, .c files are static deps, .h files are hidden deps
	- Node represents a file
		- a Node has a prioritized list of Job's to try to generate it
		- Job's with higher priorities are tried first
		- at given priority, if several jobs can be executed :
			- they are all tried in parallel, hoping that a single one will actually generate the node
				- if several of them actually generate the node, it will be an error condition
			- unless it can be certain in advance that several of them will generate the node, in which case the error is generated before execution

* the heart of the algorithm is composed of :
	- for static considerations (i.e. does not depend on Req) :
		- Node::set_buildable         : analyse a Node and determine if it can be made (3-way answer : No, Yes, Maybe)
			- calls Job::Job on Job candidates (down-hill recursion)
		- Job::Job for the plain case : construct a Job if its dependances have a chance to be makable
			 - calls Node::set_buildable on static deps (down-hill recursion)
	- for dynamic considerations (i.e. depends on Req) :
		- Node::make  : analyse a Node, calling Job::make on job candidates that can produce it
			- calls Job::make on Job candidates (down-hill recursion)
			- calls Job::make on Job's waiting for it as a dep (up-hill recursion)
		- Job::make   : analyse a Job, looking at deps and calling submit if necessary, and waking up dependents if up to date
			- calls Node::make on all deps (down-hill recursion)
			- calls Job::submit
			- calls Node::make on targets just made up-to-date (up-hill recursion)
		- Job::submit : submit a Job
			- launch job execution which will eventually trigger a call to Job::end when done
		- Job::end    : analyse a Job at end of execution, calling make to analyse the result
			- calls Job::make to analyze execution and ensure everything is ok (or re-submit if there is any reason to do so)

* state :
	- the state is directly maintainted on disk in mapped files :
		- files are located in LMAKE/store
		- code that handle them is in :
			- src/lmakeserver/store.hh&cc for its part specific to lmake
			- src/store                   for generic code that handle :
				- simple objects (possibly with side-car, i.e. a secondary storage with a 1 to 1 correspondance)
				- vectors
				- prefix-tree
				- red-black tree (not used in lmake, could be suppressed)
	- this makes booting extremely fast, suppressing the need to keep a live daemon
	- persistent states are associated to Rule, Job, Node but not Req

* traces :
	- when lmake is executed, a trace of activity is generated for debug purpose
	- this is true for all executables (lmake, lmakeserver, autodep, ...)
	- traces are located in :
		- LMAKE/trace/<executable>
			- for lmakeserver, the most important trace, an history of a few last execution is kept
		- LMAKE/trace/job_exec/<job_id> for remote job execution

* to add a backend :
	- make a file src/lmakeserver/backends/<your_backend>.cc
		- and git add it
	- use src/lmakeserver/backends/local.cc as a template
	- run 'git grep PER_BACKEND' to see all parts that must be modified
		- do whatever admin is decribed there, such as adding an enumerated value, an init of something...

* to add a command handled by the server :
	- make a file src/<your command>.cc
		- and git add it
	- use src/lshow.cc as a template
	- run 'git grep PER_CMD' to see all parts that must be modified
